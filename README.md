# FER_Library
Emotion detection using FER Library on image and video frames using OpenCV

# **Working with image**
if you need to detect emtion on image its very simple just change the (image_path) to your image directory.
and run the code, it will detect all the seven emotion with every emotion detection score in the end of cell.

# **Working with video**
if you need to detect emtion in video its very simple just change the (video_path) to your video directory.
but keep in mind if you are working with existing video the after adding video path change the parameter for VideoCapture(video_path).
if you want to work with real time detaction just keep the code is it is.
and run the code, it will detect all the seven emotion with every emotion detection score in the end of cell.

# **Project integration**
if you want to integrate it its very easy and light wight just change the code with your required specification.
for image use FER_image.py

for video use FER_video.py

this code is just for student learning who want to work with emotion detection
